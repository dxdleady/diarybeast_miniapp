# DiaryBeast Demo Pitch (2:30-3:00)

## INTRO — Problem [0:00-0:25]
**Screen:** Title slide or just you on camera

> "How many times have you started journaling and quit within a week? Most journaling apps feel like homework. There's no feedback, no progress, nothing that makes you want to come back.
>
> What if journaling felt like raising a pet — where every entry makes it grow, evolve, and unlock new abilities?"

---

## CONCEPT — What is DiaryBeast [0:25-0:45]
**Screen:** Show the egg landing page (app.diarybeast.xyz)

> "DiaryBeast is a journaling mini-app where your entries feed a digital Beast that lives onchain. Write consistently — your Beast evolves. Skip days — it gets hungry. Think Tamagotchi meets journaling, built on Base."

---

## VALIDATION — Hackathon + Testing [0:45-1:15]
**Screen:** Hackathon prototype screenshots or quick scroll-through

> "I built the first prototype for a hackathon and pitched it to mentors. The response was clear — people loved the concept of gamified journaling with a pet companion. Mentors confirmed the hypothesis: emotional attachment drives habit formation.
>
> I then ran private proto testing with over 15 users. They went through the full onboarding flow, gave feedback, and the engagement signals were strong — people named their Beasts, shared them in the feed, and kept asking when the full version launches.
>
> So my next step was clear — scale this to a wider audience and validate the funnel with real metrics."

## DEMO — Walking through the flow [1:15-2:20]
**Screen:** Live walkthrough of the mini-app

> "Here's what I built — a preview experience inside Base App where users can hatch their Beast and join the waitlist."

**[Tap the egg]**
> "You start with a glowing egg. Tap to begin."

**[Photo screen]**
> "Users can upload a selfie — the app reads color temperature from the photo and assigns a Beast that matches. Warm tones get cats and dogs, cool tones get parrots. Or you can skip."

**[Hatching video plays]**
> "Then your egg hatches — this video was generated with AI. It's a moment of delight, a dopamine hit right at the start."

**[Meet screen — Beast appears]**
> "You meet your Beast. You can reroll if you want a different one. Every step earns you XP."

**[Name -> Goal -> Intention — quick scroll]**
> "You name it, pick your journaling goal — mental health, fitness, finance, creative writing — and optionally write your first intention. Each action earns XP, and we're collecting valuable data on what users actually want."

**[Share screen]**
> "Then comes the key moment — sharing. We give a thousand XP for posting your Beast to the feed. Every share is free organic distribution in Base App."

**[Welcome screen — XP counter animates]**
> "At the end, users see their total XP, what it'll unlock, and a subscribe button. Subscribing means we can notify them on Farcaster when we launch."

## METRICS & NEXT STEPS [2:20-2:50]
**Screen:** Welcome page or back to you

> "Every screen is instrumented with PostHog. I'm tracking the full funnel — from egg tap to subscribe. I know which goal track is most popular, what percentage upload photos, how many share, and where users drop off.
>
> From the private testing: 15+ users completed the flow, and the share rate and name customization were higher than expected — people genuinely engage with their Beast.
>
> My immediate goal: get this in front of 500+ users, prove the conversion funnel, and use the data to decide which journaling track to build first."

---

## CLOSE [2:50-3:00]

> "DiaryBeast turns journaling from a chore into a game. The pet creates emotional stakes. The XP creates momentum. And Base gives us distribution. I'm looking for [feedback / support / funding] to take this from waitlist to full product."

## Presentation tips
- Hold your phone/emulator on screen and click through in real time
- Don't linger on any screen longer than 5-7 seconds
- Hatching video is the most visually strong moment — let it play
- When talking about metrics — swap in real numbers as soon as you have them
